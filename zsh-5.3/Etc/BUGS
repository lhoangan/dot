KNOWN BUGS IN ZSH
-----------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
The pattern %?* matches names beginning with %? instead of names with at
least two characters beginning with %. This is a hack to allow %?foo job
substitution without quoting. This behaviour is incompatible with sh
and ksh and may be removed in the future. A good fix would be to keep
such patterns unchanged if they do not match regardless of the state of
the nonomatch and nullglob options.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is currently impossible to time builtins.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The comp* completion-related builtins (compadd, compset, etc) are run with
$_comp_options in effect, rather than the user's options.
